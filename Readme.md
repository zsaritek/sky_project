Upon completing the Traversy Media CSS training on Udemy, I was thoroughly impressed with the projects offered. This led me to embark on recreating them myself.

Throughout the course, I gained valuable insights into the use of lightbox and Cloudflare websites. The projects provided numerous examples that significantly enhanced my proficiency in icon editing.

Additionally, working with CSS codes on larger projects granted me a deeper understanding of maintaining regularity and efficiency. I also learned how to achieve more refined imagery through background transparency.

Exploring the application of APIs in CSS expanded my comprehension of their effects and capabilities. It was enlightening to witness the impact of z-index in practice.

Furthermore, I delved into advanced techniques like flex-box, which, though initially intricate, proved to be transformative in real-world applications. Despite the initial impression of distinct styles for each section in a multi-section website, I discovered the ease of effectively reusing codes with minor adjustments for CSS and HTML layouts. This revelation streamlined the development process across various sections.
